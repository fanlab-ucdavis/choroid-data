This repository contains the original and eroded manually segmented masks used in the analysis of the manuscript "Comparison of Choroid Plexus Perfusion with Multi-Delay Arterial Spin Labeling MRI to Simultaneous 15O-Water PET ". 

In addition, we uploaded the FSL BASIL-generated ASL perfusion maps of two representative individuals seen in Figure 1 (HC009) and Supplementary Figure 4 (HC021). This data was acquired at baseline conditions. Furthermore, the PET K1 maps for all twelve participants were uploaded in addition to the structural images.    

The raw ASL scans multi-PLD nifti files are available upon request. Please email the corresponding author, Yufei David Zhu, at zhu.david.y@gmail.com to acquire this data for all 12 participants.
