# choroid-data

This repository contains the original and eroded manually segmented masks used in the analysis of the manuscript "Validation of Choroid Plexus Perfusion with Multi-Delay Arterial Spin Labeling MRI Against Simultaneous 15O-Water PET". 

Unfortunately, the ASL scans and PET K1 maps cannot be uploaded due to their large sizes (~496MB for PET K1 maps and ~2.5GB for the raw multi-PLD ASL scans for all 12 participants). If you require this data, please email the corresponding author, Yufei David Zhu, at zhu.david.y@gmail.com.
