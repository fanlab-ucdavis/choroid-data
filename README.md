# choroid-data

This repository contains the original and eroded manually segmented masks used in the analysis of the manuscript "Comparison of Choroid Plexus Perfusion with Multi-Delay Arterial Spin Labeling MRI to Simultaneous 15O-Water PET ". 

In addition, we uploaded the FSL BASIL-generated ASL perfusion maps and PMOD-generated K1 maps of two representative individuals seen in Figure 1 (HC009) and Supplementary Figure 4 (HC021). This data was acquired at baseline conditions.   

Unfortunately, the raw ASL scans multi-PLD nifti files cannot be uploaded because each nifti file exceeds the 25MB upload limit in GitHub. Please email the corresponding author, Yufei David Zhu, at zhu.david.y@gmail.com to acquire this data for all 12 participants.
